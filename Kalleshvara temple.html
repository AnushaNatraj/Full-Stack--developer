        <h1>About Kalleshvara Temple</h1>

        <p>The construction of the temple spans the rule of two Kannada dynasties: the Rashtrakuta Dynasty during the mid-10th century, and the Western Chalukya Empire, during the reign of founding King Tailapa II (also called Ahava Malla) around 987 AD. (the dynasty is also called Later or Kalyani Chalukya). The consecration of the temple was done by an individual called Duggimayya.[1][2] Art historian Adam Hardy classifies the architectural style of the temple as "Late Rashtrakuta vimana (shrine and tower) with erotic carvings, and a closed mantapa (hall), fronted by a Later Chalukya non-mainstream open mantapa, the building material for which is soapstone". The existing tower over the shrine may be a later day re-construction.[2] The temple, whose premises have yielded thirty-six old Kannada inscriptions (danashasana, lit, describing donations) from the 10th and 11th centuries, is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.[1][3]</p>
